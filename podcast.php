            <h1>AustinZone Podcast</h1>
            <p>In this practice episode, I demonstrate the my basic audio editing skills to play two demo tracks and include a couple of sound effects. An advertisement for Full Sail University is inserted as well but, first, I had to clean up a few audio issues like popping and unwanted background noise. This school project was a useful application of techniques I'll be using to make sure AustinZone Podcast sounds good and worthy of representing such a great city.</p>

                <p>The song in the intro and outro of this podcast is called "I Create" by yours truly. I wrote this song not to speak for myself but to represent the entire creative class of people in this world who bring new things into existence. This song will remain as the intro, outro, and official song of AustinZone. Check out the video for the full song and lyrics. </p>
