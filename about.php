                <p>I'm Doc Deuce. Having been an Austin resident for ten years I find myself falling more in love with the city every day. Since arriving, I've made it a point to get to know the people who make Austin tick and I've done so by supporting their contributions to the city's culture and interviewing them from time to time. My excitement about getting into the minds and hearts of these bold people is genuine and insatiable. AustinZone is my own platform from which all others can be spotlighted.</p>
